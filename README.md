### Simple RSS Reader

This project is a simple RSS reader made using Sinatra and Bootstrap.  It has a signup/login system.  When a user signs up and logs in, he/she is able to add RSS feeds to a list. The app will then fetch the newest items from the RSS feeds and display them to the user.

## Installation

To use install Simple RSS Reader, clone this repo, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`. If you are using Cloud9 like me, make sure you run 'shotgun -o $IP'
